# My Amazing Microservice

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)

'MyAmazingMicroservice' is a simple microservice that performs create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on a data source. It demonstrates new .NET Core 2.1+ practices I'm learning while studying the most up-to-date Microsoft Docs. You will see the following 

  - Microservice-oriented application
  - Simple data-driven CRUD microservice

In future, the following are going to be added 
- Multi-container application with doecker-compose.yml
- Database server running as a container
- Event-based communication between microservices (integration events) implementation
- An event bus with RabbitMQ for the development or test environment implementation
- Subscribing to events
- Testing ASP.NET Core services and web apps
- Background tasks in microservices with IHostedService implementation
- API Gateways with Ocelot implementation
